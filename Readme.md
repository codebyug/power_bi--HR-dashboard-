# Power Query Editor Steps
## This README explains the transformations performed in Power BI using the Power Query Editor to clean and prepare data for analysis.

-Applied Steps:
- Source: Data was loaded into Power BI from the source file (e.g., Excel, CSV, SQL).
- Promoted Headers: Promoted the first row as headers to assign column names.
- Changed Type: Corrected data types for each column (e.g., text, numbers, date).
- Removed Duplicates: Eliminated duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
- Added Conditional Columns:
- Applied logic-based transformations to add custom columns based on conditions (e.g., retrenchment status, distance status).
- Renamed Columns: Standardized column names for consistency.
- Filtered Rows: Removed irrelevant or incomplete data rows.
- Inserted Merged Columns: Combined fields into a single column for better analysis.
- Expanded Data: Extracted additional details from nested data or relationships.
- Reordered Columns: Adjusted column positions for a better logical flow.
